# Flappy Bird AI using NEAT and Genetic Algorithms

This project is an implementation of the popular game Flappy Bird, with a twist. Instead of being controlled by a human, the bird is controlled by an AI. The AI uses a combination of the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm and genetic algorithms to learn how to play the game.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Python   
PyGame  
N.E.A.T

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/jairajmahadev/FlappyBird-Ai-N.E.A.T.git`
2. Navigate into the directory: `cd FlappyBird-Ai-N.E.A.T-main`
3. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the game: `python flappy_genetic.py`

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The programming language used
* [NEAT-Python](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - The library used for implementing the NEAT algorithm
* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) - The library used for creating the game
